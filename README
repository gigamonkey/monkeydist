This directory contains the scripts I use to set things up form
quicklisp-distcompiler to do its job. The main workhorse is
update-archives which loops through the directories in my
~/lisp/monkeylib/ directory. Each of those directories is a git
repository of one of my libraries. If the library has changed since
update-archives was last run, it makes a new archive under the
archives/ directory here. It also creates a file archives/current.txt
with a list of each of libraries and its latest version. That
information can be used to create the monkeylib.dist file which is the
input to the quicklisp-distcompiler.
