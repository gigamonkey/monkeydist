This directory contains the scripts I use to set things up form
quicklisp-distcompiler to do its job. The main workhorse is
update-archives which loops through the directories in my
~/lisp/monkeylib/ directory. Each of those directories is a git
repository of one of my libraries. If the library has changed since
update-archives was last run, it makes a new archive under the
archives/ directory (which it will create if necessary). It also
creates a file archives/current.txt with a list of each of libraries
and its latest version. That information can be used to create the
monkeylib.dist file which is the input to the quicklisp-distcompiler.

Once the archives/ directory has been populated and the monkeylib.dist
file created, COMPILE-DIST from quicklisp-distcompiler compiles it
into a directory containing the three .txt files quicklisp needs,
gathering dependency information automatically. Then I just need to
push archives/ and monkeylib/ to somewhere where they will be served
up under the url specified in monkeylib.dist's :base-url value.
